# FICTION

Special: If you try to shelve without pendant, the shelves warp, book vanishes → you must chase it (side quest in basement).

SIDE QUESTS
Ghost Encounter (trigger: wandering between History and Fiction)

A pale ghost librarian approaches.

Choice:

Help → The ghost leads you into the basement.

Basement: You must escape. If you have the pendant, it lights the way. If not → you’re lost (death).

Reward: ID card (needed for statue).

Don’t help → The ghost curses you. The book vanishes from your hands. You’ll find it later in the basement, but it’s guarded.

OPTIONAL INTERACTIONS

Open the Book: If you choose to open it prematurely:

Pages are blank unless you’re in the right section.

In Fiction → whispers (death if you linger).

In History → cryptic warnings.

In Science → reveals a secret code (needed for final puzzle).

Secret Message: Code found in Science → must be entered into a console (simple HTML input box) to unlock the true ending.

# ENDINGS

Wrong shelf endings (death):

Fiction: Book devours you in a swirl of words.

History: Statue animates, strangles you.

Fail to escape basement:

Darkness consumes you.

Shelve correctly in Science without solving the secret code:

Book hums, vanishes. Neutral ending (survive, but mystery unresolved).

True ending:

With pendant, ID, and code, you shelve the book in Science → book bursts with light, revealing the library’s hidden truth.
